# Weather App

The assignment was a pair project to create a weather dashbord with focus on fetching API to get current temperature and forecast.


## The problem

We started with choosing a design and trying to get all the layout as close as possible. 
The new techniqes we worked with this week was fetching API as well as working in branches to make the different features.
If we had more time we would add min- and max temperature and weather icons that would change depending on the weather.
We also wanted to make the design a bit closer to the provided design.

We planned a feature freeze quite early to have enough time for debuging and finalizing the styling. If we had more time we would continue our features.
